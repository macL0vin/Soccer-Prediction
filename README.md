# Soccer-Prediction

Soccer plays a significant role in todayâ€™s lives of people. Millions of fans enjoy watching EPL games every week. They watch the games not only for the sake of sports, but because they are interested in predicting the result of the game as well. Predicting the game results is a useful but complex task. The EPL related documents are large and complicated,  the useful information is very hard to read. And invalid records will also affect the accuracy, computation time and classifier efficiency. Machine learning algorithms come to the rescue for efficiently handling and analyzing large volumes of data. They construct a model to make predictions or decisions using sample data, known as 'training data,' without being specifically programmed to perform the task. Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost algorithms and Neural networks can be used to solve a broad range of ML problems.

We are proposing a method in this research experiment to examine the EPL statistics over a particular year. This method would involve developing a model that can predict the success of any team in the playoffs based on their regular season statistics. In the meantime, the result will include analytical data to help coaches and managers get a good team review, to gain insights into how to maximize the potential for their teams to win the final championship.
